Imagined Speech Decoding Based on Prototype Networks, Multiband Fusion and Delta Band Complementation
Acknowledgments: The data acquisition and data preprocessing at the beginning of this code came from MDS_Kara_One, by Matt-Golightly, thank you very much! It was his code that helped me with this whole project, love you! Thank you!

First: run first step: get the data and labels.py, this step will get the Kara One dataset, and do some primer processing
